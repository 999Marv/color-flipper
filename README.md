A simple program that changes the background of the page when the button is pressed

used event listener and 'click'

when the button is pressed the 'random' variable picks a number from 0 to the length of the colors array

that random number becomes the index of of the colors array which is a color

so if random lands on number 6, this will match with the color 'darksalmon' and the background will switch to it.
